Your Goal: Modulus Scream
Let's modify our function to return a scream alternating between lower and capital case. For example:
console.log( scream(5) ); // aAaAa
console.log( scream(10) ); // aAaAaAaAaA
 We'll need to add a capital "A" and lower-case "a" on alternating iterations. How might we do this with the modulus operator?
