Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values 
that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of 
two space-separated long integers.

Example
[1,3,5,7,9]
Sum of max= 3+5+7+9 =24
Sum of min = 1+3+5+7=16
The minimum sum is  and the maximum sum is . The function prints
