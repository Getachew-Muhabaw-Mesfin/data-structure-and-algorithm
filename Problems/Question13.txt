Factorial
In mathematics, a factorial is often denoted with an exclamation mark !. A factorial is the product of all positive integers greater than 0 up to and including the factorial number n.

Let's take a look at a few examples of factorials:

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

2! = 2 * 1 = 2

As you can see above, 5!, pronounced "five factorial", is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. The number n, in this case 5, is multiplied by every whole number below it greater than 0, resulting in a product of 120.
