Your Goal: Go Scuba Diving!
We're going Scuba Diving! 

We need a function that can determine if the diver can breathe. The function canBreathe will be passed three boolean values:

isConnected - Is true if the diver connected to the tank
hasOxygen - Is true if the tank has oxygen
aboveWater - Is true if the diver is still above water
If the diver is still aboveWater, they can breathe regardless of the tank connection and oxygen:

canBreathe(false, false, true); // true
canBreathe(true, false, true); // true
canBreathe(true, true, true); // true
If they are not aboveWater, they need to be connected to the tank and the tank needs oxygen in order to breathe:

canBreathe(true, false, false); // false
canBreathe(true, true, false); // true
